    "When the covariance matrix is the identity matrix, the diagonal values are 1, indicating the data have variance of 1 along both of the dimensions whereas off-diagonal elements are zero, meaning that the two dimensions are uncorrelated. The data are distributed in a sphere about origin in such covariance matrix. \n",

The data in  this type of covariance matrix are also distributed in an elliptical form but not in only one dimension, instead  a linear combination of the dimensions. \n",
