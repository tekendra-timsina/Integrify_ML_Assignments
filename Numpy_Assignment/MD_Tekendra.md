Following is the submission from other pair.
* [Numpy Tutorial] -- Numpy Tutorial done by Julia and Faizan
## Assessment of Numpy Tutorial
1. The initial 7 sub-sections of section 4 were just the tutorial that needs to be done in pair. The file sent by the other pair clearly demonstrates that they have accomplished the tutorial successfully. Each command mentioned in the Numpy intro correct pdf file have been executed in the jupyter notebook by the other pair. 
2. Also, they have successfully completed the last part of the assignment, that is 4.8 Excercise. 
    -   for first part, they have implemented the argmin function to axis (0 = column) to find the row index of the minimum value for each column. In addition, they have also implemented amin function find the minimal value. 
    -   for second part, they have made the standardize function and also correctly implemented the standardization formula to generate the standardize array as an output of the input normal array.

## Experience on Colab !
We initially started the pair work in colab but thought the assignment was too easy to do in pair,so we decided to  do the tutorial independently but will write in the shared (via colab) jupyter notebook if any condusion arises. The descision was also due to the fact that colab was not updating on real time and hence it leads confusion time and again. 
When we were done we compare our code and try to come up with one final solution, which we have uploaded in github as a joint collaborator.


## Other new commands
trigonometric functions with numpy (np.cos(x)), np.transpose, np.divide, np.round(), np.indices were the new commands we learned from their submission. we already use the transpose and also divide,round and cos are familiar command to us. indices was totally new to us.
